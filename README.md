# currency-converter
React/TypeScript app using Float Rates API

Created with Vite, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit.
Validation logic added manually to avoid third party libraries (React Hook Form for a larger scale app would be applicable)
Reusable components - Form Select (with different array types able to be added to create dropdowns), Header, Buttons components, wrapped in a parent Layout structure.
Used vanilla css styling (Tailwind would be appropriate for a bigger app). Ensure responsiveness with no media queries, with use of relative values (i.e rem), and max-width properties.
Redux toolkit used for state management, with all values selected and entered, allocated in store, and split into slices.
